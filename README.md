# openMPI-OCI
Terraform script that helps you stand up an Ampere A1 parallel computing machine on OCI

**OpenMPI** is used for parallel algorithm execution allowing for integration of multiple machines into a cluster, same script can be re-used to spin up more machines and connect them together throught the --hosts argument  
 
Start an Ampere A1 server with OpenMPI installed for parallel programming, this also includes several test projects you can test the environment with

## Requirements
OCI account

## Configuration

1. Log into cloud console 
2. run the following 
```
git clone https://github.com/badr42/openMPI-OCI
cd openMPI-OCI
export TF_VAR_tenancy_ocid='<tenancy-ocid>'
export TF_VAR_compartment_ocid='<comparment-ocid>'
export TF_VAR_region='<home-region>'
export TF_VAR_core_count='2'
<optional>
# Select Availability Domain, zero based, if not set it defaults to 0
export TF_VAR_AD_number='0'
```

3. Execute the script generate-keys.sh to generate private key to access the instance
```
sh generate-keys.sh
```


## Build
To build simply execute the next commands. 
```
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```


**After applying, the service will be ready in about 25 minutes** (it will install OS dependencies, as well as the packages needed to get openMPI to work)

## Post configuration

To test the app ssh to the machine and run one of the test algorithms pre-loaded to the environment 

```
ssh -i server.key ubuntu@<instance-public-ip>
cd ~/Desktop/sharedfolder
mpirun -np 2 ./mpi-prime
```


the result should look like :

```
ubuntu@openmpi:~/Desktop/sharedfolder$ mpirun -np 20 ./mpi-prime

## Terminating the environment
When are done please run

```
terraform destroy

```


## Building a cluster

To build a cluster you can repeat this several times to build several nodes and then connect them together as shown here
